The coolest ipa signer on the planet, now open source. On par with Scarlet and Ksign. Developed and tested on iOS 17, expect compatibility issues on iOS 18 & 26. 

Signing functionality is based primarily on https://github.com/nabzclan-reborn/ArkSigning. eSign repo code compatibility is based on Feather. Other projects used are referenced in app (Will add here, WIP)

To build a ipa, run ./ipabuild.sh in the MySign folder.
