The coolest ipa signer on the planet, now open source. On par with Feather and Ksign. Developed and tested on iOS 17, expect compatibility issues on iOS 18 & 26. For anyone wondering, the UI was designed before iOS 26 released.

Based primarily on https://github.com/nabzclan-reborn/ArkSigning. Thanks to Feather for eSign repo code compatibility. Other projects used are referenced in app (Will add here, WIP)

To build a ipa, run ./ipabuild.sh in the MySign folder.
