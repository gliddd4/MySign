The coolest ipa signer on the planet, now open source. On par/better then Feather or Ksign. Developed before iOS 26 was revealed.

Based primarily on https://github.com/nabzclan-reborn/ArkSigning. Thanks to Feather for eSign repo code compatibility. Other projects used are referenced in app.

To build a ipa, run ./ipabuild.sh in the MySign folder.
